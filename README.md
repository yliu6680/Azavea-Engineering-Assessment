# Azavea-Engineering-Assessment
Code sample for the assessment

The solution is not used a pythonic way to solove the question, so the code is long. I use some basic functions and a more general way to decode the string in-place in the original string. Firstly, I allocate extra space after the original string with empty space. Then I loop through the original string, and get the modified string and replace the empty space. It could save some spaces, and run quicker than some pythonic solutions, but have more lines of code.
